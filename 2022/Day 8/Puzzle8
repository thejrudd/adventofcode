# My first approach is going to be creating a list of the characters in each direciton of the grid. 
# Then, I will find the maximum number in the list, and iterate through the list to see if any subsequent numbers
# have a greater value than the maximum. If they do, I will record the location of the value in the grid, and set the value
# of the new maximum character to that value.

# I will need to keep track of several variables
